# lwc-chartjs-donutChart
Using chartjs to render an example donut chart in a lightning web component.

### Required Step: Download the chartjs library and upload it as a static resource called "chartjs" (for this example)
Also using a lower version such as the 2.7.3 version of Chartjs as your static resource is recommended to avoid any issue when loading the javascript.
